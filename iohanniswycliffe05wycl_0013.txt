ments are bad, confessors, and therefore especially the
friars, must be traitors and heretics for concealing the
fact from their penitents‚ a conclusion so outrageous as
to make the supposition inadmissible. In his reply
Veritas deals first with the friars, and it is worthy of
note that here his language is most carefully measured.
The friars, he says, must make their own defence‚ only
they cannot be excused for choosing the unendowed life
for themselves, as the more perfect, and yet approving of
endowments in the case of others. Their duplicity,
however, cannot shake the authority of Scripture, from
which all that is good in their order is derived. Were
the order only stripped of its unscriptural accretions,
what remained would be the pure and meritorious sect
of Christ. This mention of the sectos Christ is con-
strued by Mendacium as an attack on all other sects,
and, taking up the challenge, in Chapter 20 Veritas
proceeds to prove its superiority to them all. On this
follows an argument against the splendour‚ and even the
existence, of monastic buildings, and when Mendacium
objects that, if monks be done away with, their prayers
will be lost to the Church, the bitterness of the attack
increascs, and the fraudulent and simoniacal nature of
the bargainings about prayers is sully exposed. An
accusation of fatalism is answered by an exposition of
the true doctrine of the efficacy of prayer, and it is pre-
dicted that the illgotten wealth of the clergy will bring
down on them the curse pronounced against those who
offer to God of what they have defrauded the poor.
Mendacium now takes a slightlydifserent line. Hitherto
he has adduced the existing practice and constitution of
the Church as an authority by which endowments are
defended, he now objects that the withdrawal of the
endowments would involve the overthrow of the consti-
tution, This Veritas is prepared to view with equanimity‚
and in Chapters 24-26 he argues that, if it is as Men-
dacium says, it would be good for the Church to have
