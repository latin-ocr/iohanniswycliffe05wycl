9. Vienna, 4536. ff. 336-67a.

On paper. 4to. Handwriting of the first half of the
15th century. Initials in red. With catchwords, also
glosses both in the text and on the margin. Contents
as in 3930. At end the word Plkrczlza, then in another
hand the same colophon and gloss as in 4505 and 4515,
but with the name written Wlikeff. At the end of the
Gloss: A nakonczy Palicka prziekel.

According to Dr. Herzberg-Fr'ankel the relations of
these MSS. are as follows. The Ashburnham MS. stands
by itself‚ with important differences from all the others.
The eight Vienna MSS. fall into two head-groups, of
which the first comprises 3930 and 1387, and the second
the other six. This second group may be further sub-
divided into two groups, each os three manuscripts. To
the first sub-group belong 1622, 1338, and 4302 ; to the
second 4515, 4536, and 4505. The Vienna manuscript
which approaches most nearly to the Ashburnham is
3930, but this has been corrected in another hand from
one of the manuscripts of the 4505 sub-group. Half-
way between this subagroup and the Ashburnham stands
1387, but more nearly related to the former.

The text of the present edition is taken from Lord
Ashburnham’s manuscript, transcribed some years ago by
Mr. Matthew, and collated by myself. For the portion of
Chapter 30 omitted in this manuscript, and for the Epilo-
gus, the text is taken from 1 387, transcribed for this edition
by Dr. Herzberg-Frankel. Dr. Herzberg-Frankel has also
supplied the materials for the collation of our text with
those 0f3930, 1387, 4505, and in the Epilogus, 1338. As
regards these manuscripts I have to express my regret
sor having thoughtlessly relettered them in the order of
their relation to the Ashburnham manuscript, instead os
having adopted the letters used for them by Dr. Bud-
densieg in his edition of the Latin Polemical Works.
As to the principle on which I have printed the text,
I am glad to say that Ι found the Ashburnham manu-
