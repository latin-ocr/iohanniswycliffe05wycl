in Wyclif’s teaching as to the constitution of the Church.
The same, I think, may be said of what we find written
on other points. Thus an attack is made on the exercise
for gain of the three distinctively episcopal functions of
confirmation, ordination, and consecration of places (p. 50,
l. 19), but it is not yet suggested that these can be
exercisc'd by any priest. Again, as to the endowment of
the Church, the main subject of the treatise. Wyclif
here teachcs that all property held in direct ownership
must be surrendered, but though his arguments tend in
the direction of the abolition of tithes‚ his language on
the subject is not so decided as in later works. That
he attacks the monastic system with bitterness helps as
nothing, for this was part of his earliest teaching‚ and his
virulence on this point is in strong contrast with the com-
parativcly moderate language about the Friars which we
have next to consider. As to this it must be noted that
the theory ⁴that Wyclif was friendly to the Mendicant
Orders till the end of 1381 has been decisively disproved
by Mr. Matthew. In the tract De Officio Pastm‘alz'
(which both in its Latin and English versions alludes to
Avignon as the residence of the Pope, which it had ceased
to be after Gregory XI’s triumphant entry into Rome in
1377) Wyclif is already using strong expressions against
the Friars. Indeed, if it were not that he seems, until
quite the end of his life, to have been much more
moderate on this subject in his Latin than in his English
writings, it would be difficult to explain how his language
in the Dialogus is as temperate as it actually is. At
the end of Chapter 30, and in a few other places, we have
single passages more or less strongly condemnatory of
the1n¹‚ but, as I have already obscrved, Chapter 19, of
which they form the subject, is remarkable for the
moderation of its language. This chapter, taken with
the reference to them on p. 85, as likely to support
the duty of poverty‚ suggests that the Dialogus was
