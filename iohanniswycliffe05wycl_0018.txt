xiv INTRODUCTION.

current events, we have first an important piece of negative
evidence. Few events stirred Wyclif more deeply than
Bishop Spcncer's crusade in Flanders, and his allusions
to it in his latest writings arc so frequent that it is im-
possible to believe that, in a work of the length of the
Dialogus, it would have been unnoticed had it occurred.
This is the more certain because the bearing of arms by
the clergy is actually mentioned in Chapter 4 (p. 8, l. 6),
where a reference to the crusade would have been very
apposite. In the absence of such reference we may
safely conclude that our treatise was composed not later
than 1382. was it composed in 1382? This date is
supported by the great authority of Dr. Lechlcr¹‚ and it
has in its favour a passage at the end of Chapter 5, where,
after speaking of the increase of simony, Veritas pro-
ceeds: Por lioc autmn inhabiles aspirant ad superiores
gradus sacerdocii ct impediunt verbum dez· predicari in
populo, ct anhelantes ad illud tanquam hereticos perse-
cuntur: ct isla persecucio cst lccresis sue manifestum in-
dicium ‚· nec sufficiunt pauperes cl pauci fideles sacerdotes
resistcre, nisi deus per seculare brachium vel aliunde cicius
manus apposuerit adjutrices (p. 10, l. 2 3 sqq). At first
sight this appears to be a clear reference to the appoint-
ment of Wyclif's old enemy, Courtenay‚ to be Arch-
bishop of Canterbury‚ and to those measures against the
‘ Poor Priests' which were almost his first official acts,
Anyone who holds that the date 1382 is plausible on
other grounds has a right to regard this passage as a
strong confirmation of his view: it must, however, be
remarked. (1) that there is no ground for asserting that

1382. Archbishop Courtenay receives the Pallium, May 6.—Earthquake
Councss, May 21.—Edict against Poor Priests, May 26.—Attaek on Wyclifites
at Oxford, May—November.-—Bull for the crusade against Clemcnt com-
municated to Parliament, November.—The translation of the Bible was
probably completcd this year.

1383. Bishop Spencer's Crusade in Fhmders, May—October.

draws the date 1330 which he had previously supported in the Presace to
his edition of the Trialogus.
