INTRODUCTION. xix

written at a time when Wyclif was already strongly
moved by the abuses which had crept into the Mendicant
Orders, but had not yet abandoned all hope that they
would range themselves on his side.

, It remains for us to consider those references to the
Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist which invest the date of
the Dialogus with its chief importance. According to
the passage in the Fasciculi Zizaniorum5 snb amm Domini
MCCCLXXXI, in cestatel Wyclif set forth at Oxford
twelve theses on the subject of Transubstantiation, and
it has been generally assumed that the publication of
these theses marks the date of his first opposition to the
existing doctrine of the Catholic Church. That doc-
trine, as I understand it, was, and is, that by the act
of Consecration the substance of the bread is changed
into the substance of Christ's Body, but that the ac-
cidents of the bread, such as its colour, taste‚ etc.‚ re-
main unchanged, as our eyes and palate assure us. In
opposition to this Wyclif taught that, as accidents can-
not exist without a substance, and the accidents after
Consecration are plainly not the accidents of Christ's
Body, which is in Heaven, the substance of the bread
must remain. The result, therefore, of Consecration is
not material, but spiritual, and the Host, although at
every point in it verily and indeed Christ’s Body, remains
bread as to its substance as well as in its accidents.
Besides two unimportant references on p. 32, 1. 2, and
p. 53, 1. 19, the passages which relate to this subject are
the following: (1) On p. 28, 11. 4 sqq. Veritas in arguing
against the introduction of legends into the Church, uses
as an example: cnm infesto corpom's Christi de sancto sanc-
tornm scribitur quod accidencia sunt in eucharistia sine

¹ F. Z.‚ p. 104. But the alteration of MDCCCLXXXI to MDCCCLXXX
in the heading of the Confessio (F. Z. 115, note Ι), and the fact that even
if the theses were put forth the first day of Term, only three weelzs are
allowed for all that took place before the ‘ Confessi0n‚⁷ and only six weeks
for all william of Berton's measureS‚ seriously affect the credibility of this
(late upon which so much has been founded.
