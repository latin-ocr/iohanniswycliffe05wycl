own almoners and not burden the clergy with a trust in
which they have already been found so unfaithful as to
justify the confiscation of their property. Let the king
obey Christ and confiscate their goods, and the clergy
show cause against it if they can!

We have now to deal with Chapters 31—33‚ and before
continuing our summary it must be premised that the
manuscripts about this point have become very con-,
fusing. In the Ashburnham Manuscript, Chapter 28 is
followed by Chapter 33, with a note that some chapters
are wanting. At the end of the manuscript these are
supplied, with the exception of the greater part of
Chapter 30, the leaf containing which appears to have
been lost. In the other manuscripts Chapter 31 is
omitted altogether, and that which in the text is num-
bered 32 forms the first part of the Epilogus. More will
be said on this subject later on3 for the present it is
enough to note that the arrangement in the text is by no
means free from doubt.

To the bold demand of Veritas for the confiscation
of clerical property, Mendacium replies that the secular
arm is not strong enough to enforce such a measure,
and the pope is sworn to oppose it. 'Nay more, the
pope has the power of conferring kingdoms‚ and it is
rather the clergy who should disendow the secular
lords than the secular lords who should disendow the
clergy. Against such a view of the relation of the
two orders Veritas vigorously protests‚ and he has no
difficulty in pointing out the absurdity of the conclu-
sions which might be drawn from it. He has hopes
that the clergy, if forced to *face the question, would
themselves declare against endowment‚ and in any case
the king of England should resuse to make any fresh
grants to them and should follow such precedents as the
denial of tribute to the pope.

Mendacium now advances his last objections. In
the first place, he says, glebe and church are insepar-
