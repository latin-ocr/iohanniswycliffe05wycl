no concessions of His tenants, the temporal lords, can
hold good; and the example of popes goes for nothing
unless founded on reason and Scripture. The only course
for the clergy is contrition and restitution.

Already Mendacium has shown a disposition to avoid
the test of Scripture, and he now begins a series of what
Ι have roughly called appeals to Church authority. His
main position is that endowments are supported by the
lives of the saints, but when Veritas sets up against
this the doctrine that the Scripture alone is binding,
papal bulls, indulgences and letters of bishops and of
fraternity are innocently presented for demolition, on
the ground that they rest on an authority distinct from
Scripture. In Chapter 14 the example of the saints is
recurred to, and Mendacium demands reverence for their
authority because prayers are addressed to them, In

earesully between Faith and Opinion, now points out
that it is only the Apostles whose sanctity is a matter of

as they serve to quicken devotion to Christ, they often
do hai-m, and would be better addi-essed directly to God.
This Mendacium considers as a sailure of reverence to
men whose sanctity has been approved by canonization
and miracles, and Veritas is thus given an excuse sor
attacking more abuses, while the further objections os

four Chapters which follow it are directed against the
friars and monks‚ and the doctrine of the superior efficaey

of the monasteries were mainly obtained. Mendacium
introduces the subject by the objection that, if endow-
