INTRODUCTION. xiii

may be tried. By this all three orders would be bene-
fited3 the clergy by being brought under Christ’s rule‚
the lords by being relieved from the need of oppressing
their tenants so as to give to monks‚ the labourers by
having better masters. And so, with a fervent wish that
all three orders of the church may rally to the truth‚ the
Dialogus is brought to an end. Of the Epilogue by
which it is followed, it is needless to give any full account.
As has been already said, it is scholastic in form, and we
have first three chief arguments in favour of endowment
with their appropriate refutations‚ then two others, and
then a final four. The reasoning is very close, and does
not admit of a shorter treatment than that given in the
marginal analysis.

II.

For reasons that will be apparent as we proceed‚ the
question of the date of the Dialogus is of peculiar interest.
In endeavouring to fix this date two kinds of evidence
must be considered ; (1) references to current events, (2)
the place which the treatise holds in the development of
Wyclif’s teaching. The first is capable of yielding the
most precise and the most certain results, so long as we
are careful not to see references where they do not really
exist ; the second is of great importance, but (especially
while so many of XVyclif's works remain inaccessible) is
very difficult of interpretation.

¹In trying to fix our date by means of references to

¹ For convenience of reference Ι give here the following list of dates :2

1377. Wyclif before Courtenay, Feb. 19.—Gregory XI's five bulis con-
taining a conditional citation of Wyclis, dated May 31 ; alluded to in Par-
liament, October3 published, December 18.—-Death of Edward ΙΙΙ, June 21.

1378. Wyelif before Sudbury, Feb. or March—Death of Gregory XI,
March 27.—P1·otests of Cardinals against Urban's election, July—the
subject before the English Parliament, October.—Clement VII elected Anti-
Pope, Sept. 20.-—Urban's Bull against Cleincnt, Nov. 29.—To this year is
usually assigned the beginning of the activity of XVyclif's ⁴ Poor l'riests.’

1381. Peasants' Revolt, June—To the Summer Term of this year is as-
signed the publication of Wyclif's twelve Thescs against Transubstantiation.
