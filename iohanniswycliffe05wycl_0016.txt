xii INTRODUCTION.

able3 scconffly, if the clergy surrender any part of
their income they must surrender the whole, glebe,
tithes and offerings as well as endowments. But really
there is no need for anything of the kind, as it is not
the individual ecclesiastic who holds lordship, but the
church as a whole. Veritas easily shows that the con-
nection of glcbe and church is purely arbstrary, and
applies himself to the question of restitution. This, he
says, is owed to God and not to the secular lord, who
has no claim either by God’s law or man’s. But it is not
the fact of holding property so much as the manner of it
which is to be attacked. A good curate may keep his
giche, or receive moderate offerings and tithes‚ so he be
faithful in work and free from avarice. As to the theory
that lordship rests with the church, it is an imperfection
evcn in the second order, ancl is so plainly forbidden to
the clergy that their acceptance of it ranks them under

planation of the nature of buying and selling, an attack
is now made upon the simony of the clergy‚ and the de-
structive part of the treatise comes to an end. Of the
three chapters which follow, the first is devoted to an
exposition of the manner in which each of the three
orders can and ought to come to the rescue of the
church. All must help with their prayers, and the clergy
must stir the temporal lords to restrain the enemies of
the church and withdraw from them the misnamed
alnis. A skctch of the gradual rise of the system of en-

ance of popes and bishops then follows, and their
insidious advance is ascribed to the devil. Lastly‚ we
have a bitterly ironical chapter in which the lords are
bidden to inform the clergy that they will not be damned
for their sake, and the clergy are remindcd that if the
lords have borne the burden of the present system for a
thousand years, it can be no hardship to themselves to
revert for some sevcn years to Christ's law, so that both
