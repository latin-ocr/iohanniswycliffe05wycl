vi INTRODUCTION.

us, the Speculum Ecclesie Militantis is written in the
form of a dialogue. Later on, in the Trialogns, Wyclif
was to show that he had attained at least a moderate
mastery over the difficulties of this kind of composition,
but the Dialogus was his first essay in it, and from 3
literary point of view is open to some criticism. The
persons of the dialogue are Veritas and Mendacium, and
at the outset we are told (on the authority of John xiv. 6,
and viii. 44) that the first of these stands for Christ, and
the second for the Devil. In the first three Chapters
some attempt is made to adhere to this characterization‚
and we have such sentences as ‘ Cum ego sim dens conditor
cujuslibet crcature‚' ‘ ordinavi illis regulas vivendi} ‘feci
illam scribi in duplici lestamcnt0‚' though side by side
with them are others in which Christ is spoken of in
the third person. After Chapter 3 Veritas is Wyclif,
and Wyclif only, and we have him frequently professing
the purity of his motives and his readiness to confront
the Pope, or to endure persecution for the truth. As
to Mendacium, there is no attempt at characterization
whatever. He is only a rather simple upholder of exist-
ing abuses‚ and is content to use such very Wyclifite
language as nt patet de lccresi in eucharistia ct aliis simi-
lilms qne iri fine teuzpormn diabolus spissius seminavit.
A further literary defect may be noted in the length at
which Veritas sometimes soliloquizes. His opening
statement occupies fourteen pages, and though Men-
dacium is allowed in all twenty short paragraphs‚ the
last three speeches by Veritas fill respectively nine, four,
and eleven pages ¹.

The Dialogus does not lend itself very easily to division
into sections, but we may group its thirty-six Chapters
under five fairly distinct heads. Thus 1—10 contain the

¹ It may almost be said that from Chapter 30 onwards the text has the
appearance of having been originally written without any reference to

dialogue form, and this is still more strongly the case if we look only to
Chapters 32—36.
