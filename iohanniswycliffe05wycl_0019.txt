INTRODUCTION. XV

the new Archbishop was inhabilis, though, according to
Wyclif's teaching, the pressure which his noble kinsmen
may have brought to bear may have made the appoint-
ment simoniacal ; (2) that in the Latin tract De Dcemom'o
Mer-Minue, which, from its style and appearance of having
been written soon after the death of the Black Prince
(June 8, 1376) cannot, Ι think, be placed later than early
in 1377, there is an equally distinct reference to the
opposition to faithful preachers. If this be so, 'Wyclif’s
‘Poor Priests' must have both begun their work, and
met with resistance much earlier than is supposed, and
the reference in our text may be to some previous per-
secution of them1.

Our next date-passage is a probable reference to the
death of Gregory XI in March, 1378. In Chapter
24 Mendacium had thrown out the taunt, Qualiter-
cmqute laic loquaris in angulis uon anderes ista defen-
dere vel dicere comm papa, and Veritas had answered
him, Confisus in fide audeo lzee dicere coram deo. Et sz'
mortem temporalem adlme timeo, sicul petrns, reputo quod
debeo islam sentenciam defendere coram papa. In Chapter
29 Mendacium launches a more distinct threat in the
words ista defendens cz'laberz‘s, excomnumieaberis, et ab
omnz'frncm 2'72 ccclesia utili suspenderis, to which Veritas
makes answer, Si antichristus citat hominem ad locum

¹ As this view is somewhat different to that held by the editor of the
treatise‚ Dr. Buddensieg, it is only right to quote his Presace. ¹ To judge
from the whole tone of the Tract, it must have been written shortly aster
the death os the Black Prince, who died June 8, 1377 (sie). The style also
suits this date very well . . . Ι would defend this date more keenly, unless
in the last chapter the opposition between the rich clergy, who try to hinder
the free preaching os the Gospel by the itinerant preachers‚ wcre so
strongly marked3 for according to all particulars hitherto known of the
institute os Wyclifs itinerary preachers‚ an earlier date than the year 1382
would not suit this antagonism. The date, therefore, must rcmain un-
certain.' The passage referred to runs: sac‘crdos fidelis volens gratis pre-
dicare evangelizati Jcsu C rt‘sli erit slalz'm prohil’z'lus predicare. It is to
be noted that Dr.⁴ Buddensieg here postdates the death os the Black Princo
by a year, though it is given correctly in the note on p. 418.
