INTRODUCTmN. xvii

Again the words ex semz'nacz'one sathane may be taken
either with electi suerint (= if by Satan's sowing two
popes are elected), or with duo pape (= two popes of
the seed of Satan), and the latter rendering points to a
later date than the former, as it was not until some time
after the bull of Nov. 1378, in which Urban excom-
municated and declared war on his rival, that Wyclif
lost all saith in him. In any case, however, the words
oriri possent inconveniencia multa are so, almost ludi-
crously, inadequate to describe the effects of the schism
that Ι think they must have been written when these
effects had only begun to unfold themselves, i. e. some
time in 1379.

Independently of its bearing on the date, the stage in
the development of his opinions which Wyclif had reached
in the Dialogus would naturally engage our attention.
What does the Dialogus teach as to (1) the constitution
of the Church, (2) the Friars, (3) the doctrine of Eucharist‚
are the points we have to consider, and we will take them
in order. Dr. Buddensieg has pointed out 1 that, even in
his latest works, ‘Wyclif in no passage goes so far as
downright and without modification to identify the Pope
with Antichrist or the Devil . . . The Pope is Anti-
christ only in so sar as he does or leaves undone this or
that.’ In this way, in Chapter 31, he is called Anti-
christ’s vicar rather than Christ's‚ because of his en-
croachments on the temporal power (p. 73, l. 7), and in
Chapter 7 his temporal possessions are said to make him
an ‘obstinate heretic ⁷ (p. 14, l. 4). In the same strain it
is said that the name is unknown to Scripture, and that
it might be good for the church to be without a Pope
(p. 49), while the theory that he excels all other priests
is traced to the interference of Constantine (pp. 82, 83⁷).
All this is stronger than we have in any work previous to
1378, and appears to belong to the beginning of the
second of the three stages which Dr. Lechler has traced
