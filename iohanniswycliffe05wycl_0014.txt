X INTRODUCTION.

neither pope (whose function of granting indulgences
might very well be dispensed with) nor cardinals‚ while
the bishops should be prohibited from exercising their
special powers for gain. The clergy may betake them-
selves to teaching or transcribing for their living, though
there would be no harm in their agreeing to take a
small yearly salary, and sick or disabled parish priests
would have a right to alms. Lastly‚ despite the good
they may accidentally do, the disappearance of Univer-
sities would be no loss to the Church, and all monks
should freely cast off their bonds and enter the sect of
Christ. Such is the scheme of Church reform proposed
by Veritas, and he claims for it the sanction and appro-

Mendacium threatens excommunication, only to be
answered that excommunication by Antichrist will win
blessing from Christ, and he falls back on the argument
that, if alms may be given for a certain length of time,
there can be no reason why they should not be given in
perpetuity. Veritas points out that this would prove
that because fishes can live out of water a'certain length
of time therefore they can live so for ever, and adds the
further objection that the endowment of cloisters in per-
petuity has no right to the name of alms, He continues
to press this point in answer to a proposal by Mendacium
that the temporal lords should year by year keep up
the grants of rents made by their ancestors, and thus the
clergy, without holding ownership, have the fruits for dis-
tribution among the poor. The clergy would lose their
much-prized title to endowment‚ and the lords be re-
duced to the position of rent-gatherers, and yet, after all,
the alms would be no true alms. No analogy from the
supposed fact that it was the apostles who distributed the
fragments left from the miracle of the loaves can justify
perpetual endowments‚ and the example of the apostles
after Christ’s death tells, not for, but against the dis-
tribution of alms by the clergy. Lords should find their
